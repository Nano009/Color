	<blockquote style="font-family: inherit; margin-right: 370px; margin-left: 370px; color: lightblue; text-indent: 50px;">Blues are a color that's s bit challenging to come by in the gardening world. The two best flowers for featuring true blues are Forget me nots and Himalayan Blue Popppy. Unfortunately, Himalayan Blue Poppies are extremely difficult to grow and are pretty hard to come by. Luckily for us, Forget me nots are much more forgiving, and they deliver a whole batch of pretty little blue flowers from spring to summer. They'll do well in full sun or part shade, and should naturalize well in your landscape.
